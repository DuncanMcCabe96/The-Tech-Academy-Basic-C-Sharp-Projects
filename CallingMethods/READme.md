# Math Operations Console App

## Overview
This C# console application demonstrates:
- Creating a separate class file (`MathOperations.cs`) with methods that perform math operations.
- Calling these methods from the `Main()` program (`Program.cs`).
- Handling user input and displaying results to the console.
- Using **comments** throughout the code so other developers can easily follow the logic.

---

## Features
- Prompts the user to enter an integer.
- Calls three math methods in turn:
  - **AddTen** → adds 10 to the number.
  - **MultiplyByTwo** → multiplies the number by 2.
  - **SubtractFive** → subtracts 5 from the number.
- Displays each result clearly.
- Handles invalid input gracefully with exception handling.

---

## Example Usage

### Case 1: Valid Input  
**Input:**  
8

**Output:**  
8 + 10 = 18
8 * 2 = 16
8 - 5 = 3
