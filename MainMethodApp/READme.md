# MainMethodApp

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
**MainMethodApp** is a simple C# console application that demonstrates **method overloading**.  
It defines a class (`MathOperations`) with three overloaded methods named `DoMath`, each handling different input types and performing unique math operations.  

This project is designed for learning:
- Overloaded methods in C#
- Working with different data types
- Using separate class files in a console app
