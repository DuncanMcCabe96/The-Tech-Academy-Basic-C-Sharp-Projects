# Boolean Loop Demo in C#

## Overview
This is a simple **C# Console Application** that demonstrates the use of **boolean comparisons** in both a `while` loop and a `do-while` loop.  
Each line of code is fully commented so that another developer can easily understand the logic.

## Features
- **While Loop Example**  
  - Runs as long as a condition is true.  
  - Demonstrates a counter that increments until it reaches a specified value.

- **Do-While Loop Example**  
  - Executes at least once, even if the condition is false at the start.  
  - Demonstrates a counter that increments until the condition becomes false.

- **Code Comments**  
  - Every line and block includes comments explaining its purpose and functionality.

## How It Works
1. The program first uses a **while loop** to print the value of a counter from 0 to 4.  
2. Next, it uses a **do-while loop** to print the value of another counter from 0 to 2.  
3. After completing both loops, the program waits for the user to press any key before closing.

## Example Output
```text
While Loop: Counter is at 0
While Loop: Counter is at 1
While Loop: Counter is at 2
While Loop: Counter is at 3
While Loop: Counter is at 4
Do-While Loop: Number is at 0
Do-While Loop: Number is at 1
Do-While Loop: Number is at 2
Program finished. Press any key to exit...

Requirements

.NET Framework or .NET SDK installed

How to Run

Clone or download this project.

Open it in Visual Studio or another C# IDE.

Build and run the project.

Observe how both loop types work and compare their behaviors.

Purpose

This project is intended for beginners learning C# loops. It highlights the difference between while and do-while loops and explains each line of code in detail.
